<h2>Three of my favorite Aesop's fables</h2>

<div class="main-content">

<h2>THE VIPER AND THE FILES</h2>
    <p>A Viper having entered a smith’s shop, looked up and down for something
to eat; when, casting his eye upon a file, he greedily seized upon it,
and fell to gnawing it with his teeth. After he had spent some time
in his attempts to devour it, the File told him very gruffly, that he
had better be quiet and let him alone; for he would get very little by
nibbling at one who, upon occasion, could bite iron and steel.

<h2>THE GARDENER AND HIS DOG</h2>
    <p>A Gardener’s Dog happened by some mischance to fall into the well: his
Master ran immediately to his assistance; but when helping him out, the
surly brute bit his hand. The Gardener took this ungrateful treatment
so ill, that he shook him off, and left him to shift for himself. Thou
wicked wretch! said he, to injure the hand that was stretched forth to
save thy life! The hand of thy Master, who has hitherto fed and taken
care of thee! Die there as thou deservest; for so base and unnatural a
creature is not fit to live.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-content2">

<h2>THE DOG AND THE CAT</h2>
    <p>Never were two creatures happier together than a Dog and a Cat, reared
in the same house from the time of their birth. They were so kind, so
gamesome, and diverting, that it was half the entertainment of the
family to see the gambols and love tricks that passed between them.
Still it was observed, that at mealtimes, when scraps fell from the
table, or a tit-bit was thrown to them, they would be snarling and
spitting at one another like the bitterest foes.</p>
